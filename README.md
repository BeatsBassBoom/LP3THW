This repository is just all my code from LP3THW. In order to hold myself accountable for frequent coding I started this repository. It also served as practice to learn Git, Markdown, and all the comes with coding Cybersecurity tools.

## Getting Started

There are no instructions really. This is not a tool for anyone to run, just all my coding exercises. If you wish to learn Python in the manner I did I request you pick up the LP3THW text and go through it all everyday like I did. It really was hard but I mastered much of the language over the course of ~45 days.
